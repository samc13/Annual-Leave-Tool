# Annual-Leave-Tool

A personal tool for summarising used annual leave used, booked, and remaining

## Installation

Well, you'll need python for a start: 

```bash
brew install python;
```

Make sure it worked, try: 

```bash
python3 --version;
```

You'll also need [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). 

PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.

If you've got Python3 3.4+, you should already have `pip`. 

To install a module, you can run: 

```bash
python3 -m pip install
``` 

followed by the name of a module, such as `numpy`.
